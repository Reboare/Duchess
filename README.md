# Duchess

The current focus of duchess is as a basic tv show and movie renamer, but hopefully with enough features to function as a full tv show and movie manager.

###TitleFormat
 The renaming syntax is very basic at the moment and only supports the following:
 - Variables are preceded by a $.
 - Surrounding a block in '[]' will cause it to be removed if all substituted variables are worthless
